# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

    # It makes sense to include Noto Color Emoji font into assets only if a target device can get any benefit from
    # this. For example, if the font is not available on a target device and it's not reasonable to load the font
    # via the Internet (via google_fonts package). But if we target web platform then the font will be loaded to the
    # device via the Internet in any case. Either from our own web server if we include this font into the assets.
    # Or from Google web servers if we don't include the font into assets and use GoogleFonts.notoColorEmoji instead.
    #- family: Noto Color Emoji
    #  fonts:
    #    - asset: assets/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf

    # CanvasKit has Roboto as a global fallback font since Flutter 2.0.0.
    # On Android devices the Roboto font is installed by default.
    # On Linux devices Roboto is the default font for Material Flutter app, but the font may be absent on a system.
    # Currently releases of the application are published only for web target platform. Thus it's OK to use
    # GoogleFonts.roboto instead of the asset and dowload the font from Google web servers.
    #- family: Roboto
    #  fonts:
    #    - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
